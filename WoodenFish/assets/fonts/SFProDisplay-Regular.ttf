# SF Pro Display Font Placeholder
# 
# This is a placeholder file for the SF Pro Display font.
# In a real application, you would need to:
# 1. Download the SF Pro Display font from Apple Developer Resources
# 2. Replace this file with the actual .ttf font file
# 3. Ensure you have proper licensing for the font
#
# For development purposes, the system will fall back to default fonts.
